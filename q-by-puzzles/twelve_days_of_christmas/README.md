### Questions
- What does `vs` do?
    - `x vs y`
    - Vector from Scalar
        - Partitions a symbol, string or bytestream
        - Encode a vector from an atom, or a matrix from a vector
    - In this case, `vs` is used to return a list of strings delimited by an empty space
        - `" "vs"first second third"` gives us
            - `first`
            - `second`
            - `third`
    - Opposite of this is Scalar from Vector, `sv`
        - `x sv y`
        - Can be used to return y joined by x, and also for decoding
- What is `@`?
    - Amend/Amend at
    - Used to modify one or more elements of a list, dictionary or datafile
    - Amend is expressed as `.[d;i;u]` or `.[d;i;v;vy]`, and amend at is expressed as `@[d;i;u]` or `@[d;i;v;vy]`
        - Where:
            - `d` is the atom, list, dictionary or datafile
                - If this argument is the only one missing, Amend/Amend at becomes a unary function and the value of `d` becomes the expression to its right
            - `i` is a list of indexes of d to be amended to
                - if `i` is an empty list for `.` or null for `@`, then the selection is the entire value of `d`
            - `u` is a unary (single input function)
            - `v` is a binary (two input function) and `vy` is
                - in the right domain of `v`
                    - Does this simply mean that `vy` is the right argument of `v`?
                - if selection is not `d`, it conforms to the selection and is of the same type
    - Overloaded! Also means index at
        - `((d@1)@2)@0` or `d @/ 1 2 0` means select item 0 of item 2 of item 1
- What is `$`?
    - Cond; conditional evaluation
    - Basically if/else if/else
    - Expressed as `$[test;et;ef]`
        - If `test` evaluates to 0, Cond returns ef otherwise it returns et
    - Can be nested
        - `$[q;a;r;b;s;c;d]` translates to if `q` then `a`, else if `r` then `b`, else if `s` then `c`, else `d`
    - Odd number of expressions always returns a result, even number of expressions either returns a result or a generic null
- What is `raze`?
    - Returns the items of a list `x` joined (collapses one level of nesting), and can be used to flatten values from a dictionary
        - To collapse all levels, we can use converge: `raze/[x]` (works for over and scan)
    - Not all items can be joined
        - i.e. can't join an integer with a dictionary `raze (10;d)`
    - Essentially an extension of join over `,/`
- What does `each` do?
    - `v each x` applies `v1` as a unary to each item of `x`
    - Returns a result of the same length
    - `peach` does the same task and returns the same result, but divides the work between available secondary tasks
- What does `0 1,/:{(reverse x)+2+til each 2+x}til 12` do?
    - `,/` joins the list `0 1` with the one generated by the function `{(reverse x)+2+til each 2+x}til 12`
    - `{(reverse x)+2+til each 2+x}til 12`
        - `til 12` generates an integer vector of the numbers 0 to 11 inclusive
        - `reverse x` reverses the integer vector being passed in
        - `til each 2+x` generates an integer vector of the numbers 2 to 2 + current element of x inclusive
    - All together, this gives us a nested list, with each child list containing the numbers `0`, `1` and the last `x+2` elements
